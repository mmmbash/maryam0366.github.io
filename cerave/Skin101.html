    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <div class="faq-container">
        <!-- FAQ 1 -->
        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <h3>How often should I exfoliate my skin?</h3>
                <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>The frequency of exfoliation depends on your skin type and the type of exfoliant you're using. Generally, it's recommended to exfoliate 2-3 times a week for normal and oily skin, and once a week for sensitive or dry skin. Over-exfoliation can strip the skin of its natural oils, leading to irritation or dryness.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- FAQ 2 -->
        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <h3>Can I mix different skincare ingredients?</h3>
                <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>While some skincare ingredients can be mixed for enhanced benefits, others might not react well together. For example, it's usually safe to combine hyaluronic acid with most ingredients, but using vitamin C with retinol or AHAs/BHAs can be too harsh for some skin types. It's important to do your research or consult with a dermatologist.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- FAQ 3 -->
        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <h3>What's the correct order to apply skincare products?</h3>
                <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>A general rule of thumb for skincare application is to apply products from thinnest to thickest consistency. Start with cleanser, followed by toner, serum, and eye cream. Then apply treatments or spot treatments, followed by moisturizer, and lastly sunscreen in the morning.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- FAQ 4 -->
        <div class="faq">
            <div class="faq-question">
                <h3>How can I tell if a product isn't right for my skin?</h3>
                <span class="faq-toggle">+</span>
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
                <p>If a product isn't suitable for your skin, you might experience signs such as redness, itching, burning, excessive dryness, or breakout. It's important to patch test new products before fully incorporating them into your routine. If irritation occurs, discontinue use and consult a dermatologist.</p>
